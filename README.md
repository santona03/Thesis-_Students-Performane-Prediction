# Student Performance Thesis

This repository contains my final year thesis on predicting students’ academic performance using machine learning. The project was completed using Kaggle Notebooks and an original dataset collected via Google Forms.

## Project Overview
The goal of this thesis is to analyze and predict students’ academic performance based on multiple factors such as attendance, study habits, and other performance metrics. Various machine learning models were applied, and feature selection and hyperparameter tuning were performed to improve accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platform:** Kaggle Notebooks
- **Dataset:** Own collected dataset via Google Forms

## Files
- `thesis.ipynb` – Main thesis notebook containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation.  
- `StudentsData.csv` – Dataset collected from students via Google Forms.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection using multiple methods
- Training and evaluating machine learning models (Random Forest, CatBoost, SVM, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance

## Notes
This repository is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow from data collection to model evaluation.
